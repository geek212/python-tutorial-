#### Python’s Arithmetic Operators #####


# + Addition 1 + 1 = 2
# - Subtraction 10 - 1 = 9
# * Multiplication 3 * 5 = 15
# / Division 10 / 5 = 2
# % Modulus (remainder after division) 11 % 5 = 1
# ** Exponent 3**2 = 9
# // Floor division 11 // 5 = 

# The first four items in the table are the same as you learned in elementary school. 
# The last three are a little more advanced so we’ll explain them here:
# » The modulus is the remainder after division. So, for example, 11 % 5 is 1 
# because if you divide 11 by 2 you get 5 remainder 1. That 1 is the modulus 
# (sometimes called the modulo).

# » The exponent is ** because you can’t type a small raised number in code. But 
# it just means “raised to the power of” in the sense that 3**2 is 32 or 3 squared, 
# which is 3*3 or 9. And of course 3**4 would be 3*3*3*3 or 81.
# » Floor division, indicated by //, is integer division in that anything after the 
# decimal point is truncated (ignored). The term truncated in this sense means 
# “cut off,” without any rounding. For example, in regular division 9/5 is 1.8. 
# But 9//5 is just 1 because the .8 is just chopped off, it doesn’t even round 
# up the 1 to a 2

# Operator Meaning

# < Less than
# <= Less than or equal to
# > Greater than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to
