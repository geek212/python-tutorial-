import os
print (os.listdir())

import print
import Set_datatype
# u can import ur code files with import

''' The listdir() function is a function provided by the os (operating system)module, 
and by using this function, we can print a list of names of all the files present in the specified path.'''




# What are Python Modules?
''' In Python, Modules are simply files with the “.py” extension containing Python code 
that can be imported inside another Python Program. '''


# How to create Python Modules?
''' To create a module, we have to save the code that we wish in a file with
 the file extension “.py”. Then, the name of the Python file becomes the name of the module.'''



# Advantages of Modules.
# Some of the advantages while working with modules in Python is as follows:

# Reusability
# Working with modules makes the code reusable.

# Simplicity
# The module focuses on a small proportion of the problem, rather than focusing on the entire problem.

# Scoping
# A separate namespace is defined by a module that helps to avoid collisions between identifiers.
 


''' Python Built-in Modules'''
# As we know that the Python interactive shell has a number of built-in functions. 
# As a shell start, these functions are loaded automatically and are always available, such as,

# print() and input() for I/O,
# Number conversion functions such as int(), float(), complex(),
# Data type conversions such as list(), tuple(), set(), etc.


# In addition to these many built-in functions, there are also a large number of pre-defined 
# functions available as a part of libraries bundled with Python distributions. 
# These functions are defined in modules which are known as built-in modules


help ("modules")
# These built-in modules are written in C language and integrated with the Python shell.
