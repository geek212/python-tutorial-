Python is My frist language this scripts are my learning methods 

The source which i used for learning_python is Google,youtube,also books in pdf fromat
it was not easy to self_learn cozz knowledge is distributed u have to fliterd and sort it.


To start to learn was diffcult but when u get familiar with python then its favorable 
i don't have any CS or Btech , my education was in commerce streams ,


IDE i use is VSCODE not pycharm or anaconda 
and even jupyter notebook ,

i want to have a strong grip in pythons basic especially when their is word that python is a easy language to learn
which is a myth . non coder have a mindset that its just alphabets and numbers which we use in python
or other languages .

i really dont want to be overwhelmed by the idea that its 
[EASY].

when comes to typing their will be so much error especially with words and with (,), (.), (/), (*), (#), ("") etc
for a beginners .

This is my experience while codeing u have to put efforts to understand  python .
