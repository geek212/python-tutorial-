Python is frist language this scripts are my learning methods 

The source which i used for learning_python is Google,youtube,also books in pdf fromat
it was not easy to self_learn cozz knowledge is distributed u have to fliterd and sort it


To start to learn was diffcult but when u get familiar with python then its favorable 
i don't have any CS or Btech , my education was in commerce streams 

my aim to learn python is personal and also hope to job
