Python is My frist language this scripts are my learning methods 

The source which i used for learning_python is Google,youtube,also books in pdf fromat
it was not easy to self_learn cozz knowledge is distributed u have to fliterd and sort it.


To start to learn was diffcult but when u get familiar with python then its favorable 
i don't have any CS or Btech , my education was in commerce streams ,


IDE i use is VSCODE not pycharm or anaconda 
and even jupyter notebook ,

i want to have a strong grip in pythons basic especially when their is word that python is a easy language to learn
which is a myth . non coder have a mindset that its just alphabets and numbers which we use in python
or other languages .

i really dont want to be overwhelmed by the idea that its 
[EASY] .

when comes to typing their will be so much error especially with words and with (,), (.), (/), (*), (#), ("") etc
for a beginners .

This is my experience while codeing u have to put efforts to understand  python .

 now this repository will be Beginner level of python 
 
 This are the following index i studies python
 
 >1 print.py <
 >2 Data types.py <
 >3 Variables.py <
 >4 multiple assignments <
 >5 python operators.py <
 >6 type_casting.py <
 
 Now starts the real deal in pythons basics by me , cuzz i  Self_studying that mean i have to 
 manage it what should i focus and what_not according my goal 
 
 So here we go with pythons index
 
 >7 input_function.py <
 >8 Strings.py <
 
 Now data structure data_types of lists
 
 >9 List_datatype.py <
 >10 Python For Loop - For i and Range.py <
 >11 List_sort_advance.py <
 
 And now with Tuple or two pull 
 >12 Tuple_datatype.py <
 
 Now confusing part difference between Dictionaries  and Set both have {} curve brackets
 man this datatype really pissed me off 
 >13 Dictionaries.py <
 >14 Set_datatype.py <
  
  
 And final one is most important for our codeing mindset
 >15 Zen_of_python.py<
 Just Wikipedia this stuff as whole for ur understanding 
 
 
 second repository which i want to cerate it will be intermediate level of python
 
 now pratice , pratice , pratice ................... i m saying for my self 


<|THANK_YOU|> ........ For reading
