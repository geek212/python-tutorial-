''' Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming 
language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. 
It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun,
 the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python. 
 Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, 
 replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles
  much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on 
fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details..'''

'''The Python print() function takes in any number of parameters, 
and prints them out on one line of text. The items are each converted 
to text form, separated by spaces, and there is a single '\n' at the end 
(the "newline" char). When called with zero parameters, print() just prints 
the '\n' and nothing else. In the interpreter, standard-out displays to the
screen in between the '>>>' prompts, 
so it's an easy way to see what print() does.'''

''' Python and AI

 AI researchers are fans of Python. Google TensorFlow, 
 as well as other libraries (scikit-learn, Keras), 
 establish a foundation for AI development because of 
 the usability and flexibility it offers Python users. 
 These libraries, and their availability, are critical 
 they enable developers to focus on growth and building. '''
